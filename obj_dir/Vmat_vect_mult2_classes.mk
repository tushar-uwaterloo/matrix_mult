# DESCRIPTION: Verilator output: Make include file with class lists
#
# This file lists generated Verilated files, for including in higher level makefiles.
# See Vmat_vect_mult2.mk for the caller.

### Switches...
# Coverage output mode?  0/1 (from --coverage)
VM_COVERAGE = 0
# Tracing output mode?  0/1 (from --trace)
VM_TRACE = 1
