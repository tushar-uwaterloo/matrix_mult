## Q3. Area-time tradeoffs

### Resource Utilization

The utilization is reported using `yosys` and the script for generating the report is `run_yosys.ys`.

```

   Number of wires:                326
   Number of wire bits:            416

```

By default, `yosys` does not use DSPs and instead use LUTs to implement the addition and multiplication logic.

The following result is generated using `vivado` and the `edif` file generated by `yosys`:


```
+----------+------+---------------------+
| Ref Name | Used | Functional Category |
+----------+------+---------------------+
| LUT6     |  133 |                 LUT |
| MUXF7    |   56 |               MuxFx |
| LUT5     |   43 |                 LUT |
| FDCE     |   38 |        Flop & Latch |
| LUT3     |   26 |                 LUT |
| LUT2     |   24 |                 LUT |
| MUXF8    |   13 |               MuxFx |
| LUT4     |    8 |                 LUT |
| CARRY4   |    5 |          CarryLogic |
+----------+------+---------------------+
```

With the optimization introduced by `vivado`, the number of `LUT6` primitive is less than that in `yosys`.

### Trade-offs

The problem statement requires that the data is streamed into the design one at a time, and the vector is streamed into the design at the beginning.
Every element of the matrix will be used to calculate one multiplication and the result will be used in at most one addition. Thus, even if we can use multiple adders and multipliers, the data stream of matrix will limit the parallelism we can achieve and multiple adders/multipliers will not bring us any benefits.
